## Running Tests üß™

This project uses [melos][melos_link] for convenience scripts such as running tests and coverage. All of these scripts can be run from any directory in the project, and are defined in the root `melos.yaml` file.

To activate melos, run the following command:

```sh
dart pub global activate melos
```

After that, to run all unit tests:

```sh
melos test
```

To run all tests and generate coverage report:

```sh
melos test:cov
```

To view the generated coverage report using [lcov][lcov_link] in your browser, run:

```sh
melos open:cov
```

If you want to reproduce the CI analyze job locally, you can run:

```sh
melos analyze
```
