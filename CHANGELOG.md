# 3.0.0

 - feat: Support for Riverpod 3!

 - BREAKING: cacheDataFor cannot be used on FutureProvider. Instead use it on AsyncNotifier.
 - BREAKING: refreshWhenNetworkAvailable cannot be used on FutureProvider. Instead use it on AsyncNotifier.

 Some extensions that were previously available on FutureProvider are now only usable inside AsyncNotifier. This is due to the fact that `Ref` does not take a generic type parameter anymore.
