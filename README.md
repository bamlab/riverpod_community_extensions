Community extensions for Riverpods

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using Riverpods Community Extensions you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Install via `dart pub add`:

```sh
dart pub add riverpods_community_extensions
```

---

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Riverpods Community Extensions comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests üß™

This project uses [melos][melos_link] for convenience scripts such as running tests and coverage. All of these scripts can be run from any directory in the project, and are defined in the root `melos.yaml` file.

To activate melos, run the following command:

```sh
dart pub global activate melos
```

After that, to run all unit tests:

```sh
melos test
```

To run all tests and generate coverage report:

```sh
melos test:cov
```

To view the generated coverage report using [lcov][lcov_link] in your browser, run:

```sh
melos open:cov
```

If you want to reproduce the CI analyze job locally, you can run:

```sh
melos analyze
```
